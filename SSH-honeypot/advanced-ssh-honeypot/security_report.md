\- \*\*Tools:\*\* Likely automated scanning tools

\- \*\*Attack Rate:\*\* High frequency (2.7 attacks/minute)



\### Risk Factors

1\. \*\*Root Account Targeting:\*\* 44% of attacks target root access

2\. \*\*Password Patterns:\*\* 33% use simple sequential numbers

3\. \*\*Account Enumeration:\*\* Attackers testing multiple usernames

4\. \*\*Automated Behavior:\*\* Consistent attack patterns suggest automation

5\. \*\*Sustained Activity:\*\* No breaks in attack pattern indicates automated tools



\### Attack Characteristics

\- \*\*Method:\*\* Automated brute force

\- \*\*Target Selection:\*\* Common system accounts (root, admin, user, test)

\- \*\*Password Strategy:\*\* Mix of simple patterns and random attempts

\- \*\*Sophistication:\*\* Basic automated scanning tools



\## Security Recommendations



\### Immediate Actions (High Priority)

1\. \*\*Disable Root SSH Access\*\* - Require key-based authentication only

2\. \*\*Implement Account Lockout\*\* - Block IPs after 3-5 failed attempts

3\. \*\*Strong Password Policy\*\* - Enforce 12+ character complex passwords

4\. \*\*Multi-Factor Authentication\*\* - Add SMS/authenticator app verification

5\. \*\*Change Default Ports\*\* - Move SSH from port 22 to non-standard port

2\. \*\*SSH Key Authentication\*\* - Disable password authentication entirely

3\. \*\*Network Segmentation\*\* - Isolate SSH services from critical systems

4\. \*\*Log Monitoring\*\* - Real-time alerting for failed login attempts

5\. \*\*User Account Review\*\* - Remove or secure unnecessary accounts



\### Long-term Improvements (Low Priority)

1\. \*\*Intrusion Detection System\*\* - Deploy IDS/IPS for advanced threat detection

2\. \*\*Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)\*\* - Centralized log analysis

3\. \*\*Security Operations Center\*\* - 24/7 security monitoring and response

4\. \*\*Regular Penetration Testing\*\* - Validate security controls quarterly
