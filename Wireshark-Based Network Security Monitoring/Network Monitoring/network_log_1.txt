NETWORK MONITORING LOG - SESSION 1
Date: [2025/08/26]
Time: [14:34]
Duration: [00:04:50]

OBSERVATIONS:
- Total packets captured: 10,884+
- Network interface: Wi-Fi
- Active protocols seen: QUIC, TLSv1.2, TCP, DNS
- No dropped packets: 0% (excellent capture quality)

TRAFFIC PATTERNS:
- Internal IP: 10.0.0.101 (your computer)
- External connections: 104.18.18.125, 23.196.227.237, 208.103.161.1, 3.92.13.104
- Port 443 traffic: HTTPS/encrypted web traffic
- QUIC protocol: Modern web browsing (Google, YouTube, etc.)

DETAILED OBSERVATIONS:
- Frame 8354: 233 bytes, encrypted TLS traffic
- Source: 3.92.13.104:443 (external HTTPS server)
- Destination: 10.0.0.101:55146 (your computer)
- Protocol: TLS over TCP (secure web traffic)

TRAFFIC ANALYSIS:
- High volume: 10,000+ packets in short time
- Consistent patterns: Regular web browsing activity
- Encryption: All sensitive data is TLS encrypted
- Port 443: Standard HTTPS traffic (secure websites)

NOTABLE FINDINGS:
- TLS encryption: Normal secure web traffic
- QUIC packets: Modern web protocols
- TCP connections: Standard internet communication
- No obvious suspicious activity detected

SECURITY ASSESSMENT:
- No suspicious connections detected
- All external traffic uses standard ports
- Encryption protocols are current (TLS)
- Traffic patterns match normal internet usage
EXPERT ANALYSIS FINDINGS:
- Capture duration: 4 minutes 50 seconds
- Total data: 8.7 MB captured
- Average: 37.5 packets per second

NETWORK EVENTS DETECTED:
- TCP retransmissions: 100 (network congestion or packet loss)
- DNS retransmissions: 4 (DNS server response issues)
- QUIC decryption failures: 74 (normal for encrypted traffic)
- Connection resets: 60 (normal connection cleanup)
- Keep-alive segments: 2 (maintaining connections)

ANOMALY ASSESSMENT:
- High retransmission rate: Possible network congestion
- DNS issues: Minor network performance concern
- QUIC failures: Normal (can't decrypt encrypted traffic)
- Overall: Network functioning normally with minor performance issues

SECURITY INSIGHT:
- All suspicious events are performance-related, not security threats
- No malicious traffic patterns detected
- Network behavior consistent with normal internet usage

CONCLUSION:
Normal web browsing activity detected. No security concerns identified.
