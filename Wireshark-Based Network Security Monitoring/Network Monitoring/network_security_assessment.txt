NETWORK TRAFFIC ANALYSIS PROJECT - FINAL SECURITY ASSESSMENT
Date: [2025/08/26]
Time: [16:00]
Analyst: [Azaldo Mazibuko]
Session Duration: 4 minutes 50 seconds

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:
Successfully completed comprehensive network traffic analysis using Wireshark and built-in Windows tools. 
Monitored Wi-Fi interface for suspicious activity and established baseline of normal network behavior.

TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS:
- Capture Interface: Wi-Fi
- Total Packets Captured: 10,884
- Capture Duration: 4 minutes 50 seconds
- Data Volume: 8.7 MB (8,352,974 bytes)
- Average Traffic Rate: 37.5 packets/second
- Packet Drop Rate: 0% (excellent capture quality)
- Operating System: Windows 11 (24H2)

TRAFFIC ANALYSIS RESULTS:

1. PROTOCOL DISTRIBUTION:
   - TCP: Primary protocol (encrypted HTTPS traffic)
   - TLS: Secure web communications
   - QUIC: Modern web protocols
   - DNS: Name resolution queries

2. CONNECTION PATTERNS:
   - Internal IP: 10.0.0.101 (local machine)
   - External Connections: Multiple HTTPS servers (ports 443)
   - DNS Server: 10.0.0.254 (local network)
   - No SSH traffic detected (port 22)

3. TRAFFIC CHARACTERISTICS:
   - Average packet size: 767 bytes
   - Data rate: 28 KB/s average
   - All sensitive traffic encrypted via TLS
   - Normal web browsing patterns observed

SECURITY ASSESSMENT:

1. THREAT ANALYSIS:
   - NO malicious activity detected
   - NO suspicious connections identified
   - NO unauthorized access attempts
   - NO data exfiltration patterns

2. NETWORK PERFORMANCE ISSUES:
   - TCP retransmissions: 73 instances (network congestion)
   - Out-of-order segments: 3 instances (minor)
   - DNS retransmissions: 4 instances (DNS server response delays)
   - Connection resets: 60 instances (normal cleanup)

3. SECURITY POSTURE:
   - EXCELLENT: All web traffic properly encrypted
   - GOOD: No unencrypted HTTP traffic detected
   - GOOD: Standard port usage (80, 443, 53)
   - GOOD: No suspicious port scanning activity

TOOLS AND TECHNIQUES USED:
- Wireshark 4.4.8 for packet capture and analysis
- Expert Information analysis for traffic assessment
- Advanced filtering techniques for threat hunting
- Built-in Windows network commands for system-level analysis
- Manual traffic pattern recognition and analysis

THREAT HUNTING RESULTS:
- Applied filters: tcp.flags.reset, tcp.len > 1000, ip.src, dns, http
- No suspicious patterns found in filtered traffic
- All detected anomalies are performance-related, not security threats
- Network behavior consistent with normal internet usage

RECOMMENDATIONS:

1. CONTINUOUS MONITORING:
   - Establish regular network monitoring sessions
   - Monitor for changes in traffic patterns
   - Watch for new external connections

2. PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATION:
   - Investigate DNS server response times
   - Monitor network congestion during peak usage
   - Consider network quality improvements

3. SECURITY ENHANCEMENTS:
   - Continue current security practices
   - Monitor for new threat indicators
   - Maintain encryption standards

CONCLUSION:
Network security assessment completed successfully. No security threats detected. 
Network shows normal, secure web browsing activity with minor performance issues.
All sensitive communications properly encrypted. System security posture: EXCELLENT.

FUTURE MONITORING:
- Repeat analysis monthly or when network behavior changes
- Document any new traffic patterns
- Monitor for emerging threat indicators
- Maintain baseline of normal network activity
